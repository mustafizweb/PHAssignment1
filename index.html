            <h2>Salad Recipes</h2>
            <p>
                Salad can be a thing of beauty—a colorful, bountiful platter of seasonal produce, tossed with a homemade salad dressing, maybe a protein added to transform your salad into dinner. From hearty cobb salad recipes to easy summer salad recipes, light and healthy salad recipes to wintery salads loaded with root veggies, we’ve rounded up all of our very best salad recipes, and—while we were at it—we’ve included our salad dressing recipes, too! Nutritious and delicious, we can say with confidence that there’s a salad recipe (or two, or three) that you’ll love in this mix.

                <p> A big green salad topped with a curry-spiced grilled chicken, goat cheese and a delicious punchy herb-filled vinaigrette is basically heaven on a platter, and makes a terrific dinner salad. </p>

                <h3>Recipe Title</h3>
                <p>For our chicken Waldorf salad recipe, we combine the sweet and savory flavor combo that we all know and love with a few “grown-up” substitutions that make it even better than the original.</p>

                <p>Dotted with just-sweet-enough golden raisins, tender chicken pieces and crisp celery are coated in a vibrant yellow, curry powder-spiked dressing. We love it in a sandwich, and big green salad.</p>
